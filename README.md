# DyzCarSystem
This is a vehicle hud on the FiveM NUI that I implement while starting to write FiveM resource. It's use a lua code based from [FiveM-SimpleCarHUD](https://github.com/bepo13/FiveM-SimpleCarHUD) And clean up the source by [Holfz](https://github.com/Holfz).

Actually, This resource is created for use on my own server. But there's some Thai people stole my code and sold it in their name without my permission.

So I decided to open source this HUD because I don't want to see people would have to waste thier money to the thief anymore.
