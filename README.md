## Note
```
Currently, I have another project to do. So I might not have time to fix bugs or add features. Sorry :(

# DyzCarSystem
This is a vehicle hud on the FiveM NUI that I implement while starting to write the FiveM resource. It's a Lua code based on [FiveM-SimpleCarHUD](https://github.com/bepo13/FiveM-SimpleCarHUD) And cleans up the source by [Holfz](https://github.com/Holfz).

This resource is created for use on my server. But some Thai people stole my code and sold it in their name without my permission.

So I decided to open source this HUD because I don't want to see people would have to waste their money to the thief anymore.
